🏗️ Algorithm Architecture Key Mathematical Models

Annual Returns Calculation
investment_return = investment_capital × investment_return_rate savings_return = savings_capital × savings_return_rate

Expense Allocation with Intelligent Capping
if expense_allocation > investment_return: expense_cap_activated = True next_year_expense = current_expense # No increase else: expense_cap_activated = False next_year_expense = current_expense × (1 + annual_increase_rate)

Emergency Withdrawal Priority
Use savings capital first (preserves investment compounding)
Use investment capital only if savings insufficient
Never go into debt
